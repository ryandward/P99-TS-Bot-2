# EverQuest Discord Bot - TypeScript Edition

Welcome to the EverQuest Discord Bot TypeScript Edition repository! This project, originally developed in Python and meticulously reworked in TypeScript, demonstrates advanced capabilities in creating robust, type-safe, and scalable chat-interfacing bots. Leveraging TypeScript’s strict type-checking and ESNext features, along with powerful integrations like Elasticsearch, this bot enhances management and engagement within EverQuest gaming communities on Discord.

## Introduction

The EverQuest Discord Bot TypeScript Edition is designed to optimize community management through Discord, integrating seamlessly with game data and external APIs. It excels in smart storage solutions and real-time data retrieval, including integration with Elasticsearch for efficient full-text search capabilities across distributed systems.

Key features include:

- **User Authentication**: Securely link Discord users to their EverQuest characters.
- **Character Management**: Track and manage character data such as levels, classes, and equipment.
- **DKP System**: Implement a fair loot distribution system using Dragon Kill Points (DKP).
- **Event Scheduling**: Organize and schedule in-game events, raids, and meetings directly through Discord.
- **Census Data**: Maintain real-time character census, including alts and bots, within the guild.
- **MediaWiki Integration**: Utilize a local clone of the Project 1999 Wiki for comprehensive guild bank management.

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript**: Ensures code reliability and maintainability with static typing.
- **Discord.js**: Provides interactive bot features and integrates seamlessly with Discord.
- **TypeORM**: Facilitates object-relational mapping for database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: Utilized for robust data storage and scalable performance.
- **Elasticsearch**: Enhances search functionalities for efficient data retrieval.
- **MediaWiki**: Supports local wiki interactions for guild management.
